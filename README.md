# Realtime YAMNET Sound Event Detection

A real-time Sound Event Detection (SED) system powered by [YAMNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet), utilizing your device's microphone for continuous audio analysis.

## Overview

This application performs real-time sound event detection using Google's YAMNet deep neural network model, which can identify 521 different audio events. The system processes audio input every second and displays the top 5 most probable sound events it detects.

## Features

- Real-time audio processing using PyAudio
- Continuous sound event detection using YAMNet
- Display of top 5 detected sound events with confidence scores
- Support for 521 different audio event classes
- Low-latency processing (1-second intervals)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyAudio
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime_YAMNET.git
cd realtime_YAMNET
```

2. Download the pre-trained YAMNet model:
```bash
# Download manually from Google Storage
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/yamnet.h5
# Place the downloaded file in the yamnet folder
mv yamnet.h5 yamnet/
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pyaudio
```

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
python realtime_YAMNET.py
```

The system will immediately begin capturing audio from your default microphone and display real-time detection results.

## How It Works

1. The system captures audio input through your device's microphone using PyAudio
2. Audio is processed in 1-second segments
3. YAMNet analyzes the audio segment and produces probability scores for 521 different sound events
4. The top 5 most probable sound events are displayed in real-time
5. The process continues until the application is terminated

## Supported Sound Events

YAMNet can detect 521 different audio events from the [AudioSet ontology](https://research.google.com/audioset/), including:
- Human sounds (speech, whistling, laughing)
- Animal sounds (dog barking, cat meowing, bird songs)
- Musical instruments
- Vehicle sounds
- Environmental sounds
- And many more...
